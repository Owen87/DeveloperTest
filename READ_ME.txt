Hi there!

I've made the project with Java, using Eclipes as my IDE. There's an Event object class, and the main method to run everything is located in the Run file.
I've also included a brief report documenting the planning stage and some explanations of my code.

If you need anything else, just give me a shout!

All the best,
- Owen O'Donnell
